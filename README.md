**Tentyping** - Typing practice website. 

See [www.tentyping.com](https://tentyping.com)

# Motivation
At the moment, there are many services that are aimed at teaching and improving typing skills. Most of them have too many configurations and prerequisites to just start typing. 

Tentyping does not have the goal of teaching you how to type correctly, how to align fingers on the keyboard or something like that. The only goal is to provide you with a service without extra settings and conditions, just go and type, looking at the main indicators such as WPM (Words Per Minute), accuracy and the number of misspelled characters.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I do
